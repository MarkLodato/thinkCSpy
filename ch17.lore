<h1>Sets of objects</h1>

<h2>Composition</h2>
<span class="index" value="composition" />
<span class="index" value="nested structure" />

<p>By now, you have seen several examples of composition.  One of the first
examples was using a method invocation as part of an expression.  Another
example is the nested structure of statements; you can put an <code>if</code>
statement within a <code>while</code> loop, within another <code>if</code>
statement, and so on.</p>

<p>Having seen this pattern, and having learned about lists and objects, you
should not be surprised to learn that you can create lists of objects.  You can 
also create objects that contain lists (as attributes); you can create lists
that contain lists; you can create objects that contain objects; and so on.</p>

<p>In this chapter and the next, we will look at some examples of these
combinations, using <code>Card</code> objects as an example.</p>


<h2><code>Card</code> objects</h2>
<span class="index" value="Card" />
<span class="index" value="class!Card" />

<p>If you are not familiar with common playing cards, now would be a good time
to get a deck, or else this chapter might not make much sense.  There are
fifty-two cards in a deck, each of which belongs to one of four suits and one
of thirteen ranks.  The suits are Spades, Hearts, Diamonds, and Clubs (in
descending order in bridge).  The ranks are Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
Jack, Queen, and King.  Depending on the game that you are playing, the rank of 
Ace may be higher than King or lower than 2.</p>

<span class="index" value="rank" />
<span class="index" value="suit" />

<p>If we want to define a new object to represent a playing card, it is obvious 
what the attributes should be: <code>rank</code> and <code>suit</code>.  It is
not as obvious what type the attributes should be.  One possibility is to use
strings containing words like <code>"Spade"</code> for suits and
<code>"Queen"</code> for ranks.  One problem with this implementation is that
it would not be easy to compare cards to see which had a higher rank or suit.
</p>

<span class="index" value="encode" />
<span class="index" value="encrypt" />
<span class="index" value="map to" />

<p>An alternative is to use integers to <b>encode</b> the ranks and
suits.  By <q>encode,</q> we do not mean what some people think, which is to
encrypt or translate into a secret code.  What a computer scientist means by
<q>encode</q> is <q>to define a mapping between a sequence of numbers and the
items I want to represent.</q> For example:</p>

<pre>
Spades   --&gt;  3
Hearts   --&gt;  2
Diamonds --&gt;  1
Clubs    --&gt;  0
</pre>

<p>An obvious feature of this mapping is that the suits map to integers in
order, so we can compare suits by comparing integers.  The mapping for ranks is 
fairly obvious; each of the numerical ranks maps to the corresponding integer,
and for face cards:</p>

<pre>
Jack   --&gt;  11
Queen  --&gt;  12
King   --&gt;  13
</pre>

<p>The reason we are using mathematical notation for these mappings is that
they are not part of the Python program.  They are part of the program design,
but they never appear explicitly in the code.  The class definition for the
<code>Card</code> type looks like this:</p>

<pre class="python">
class Card:
    def __init__(self, suit=0, rank=0):
        self.suit = suit
        self.rank = rank
</pre>

<p>As usual, we provide an initialization method that takes an optional
parameter for each attribute.</p>

<span class="index" value="constructor" />

<p>To create an object that represents the 3 of Clubs, use this command:</p>

<pre class="python">
three_of_clubs = Card(0, 3)
</pre>

<p>The first argument, <code>0</code>, represents the suit Clubs.</p>


<h2>Class attributes and the <code>__str__</code> method</h2>
<span class="index" value="class attribute" />
<span class="index" value="attribute!class" />

<p>In order to print <code>Card</code> objects in a way that people can easily
read, we want to map the integer codes onto words.  A natural way to do that is 
with lists of strings.  We assign these lists to
<b>class attributes</b> at the top of the class definition:</p>

<pre class="python">
class Card:
    suits = ["Clubs", "Diamonds", "Hearts", "Spades"]
    ranks = ["narf", "Ace", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7",
                "8", "9", "10", "Jack", "Queen", "King"]
   
    def __str__(self):
        return (self.ranks[self.rank] + " of " +
                self.suits[self.suit])
</pre>

<p>A class attribute is defined outside of any method, and it can be accessed
from any of the methods in the class.</p>

<p>Inside <code>__str__</code>, we can use <code>suits</code> and
<code>ranks</code> to map the numerical values of <code>suit</code> and
<code>rank</code> to strings.  For example, the expression
<code>self.suits[self.suit]</code> means <q>use the attribute
<code>suit</code> from the object <code>self</code> as an index into the class
attribute named <code>suits</code>, and select the appropriate string.</q>
</p>

<p>The reason for the <code>"narf"</code> in the first element in
<code>ranks</code> is to act as a place keeper for the zero-eth element of
the list, which will never be used.  The only valid ranks are 1 to 13.  This
wasted item is not entirely necessary.  We could have started at 0, as usual,
but it is less confusing to encode 2 as 2, 3 as 3, and so on.</p>

<p>With the methods we have so far, we can create and print cards:</p>

<pre class="python-interpreter">
>>> card1 = Card(1, 11)
>>> print card1
Jack of Diamonds
</pre>

<p>Class attributes like <code>suits</code> are shared by all <code>Card</code> 
objects.  The advantage of this is that we can use any <code>Card</code> object 
to access the class attributes:</p>

<pre class="python-interpreter">
>>> card2 = Card(1, 3)
>>> print card2
3 of Diamonds
>>> print card2.suits[1]
Diamonds
</pre>

<p>The disadvantage is that if we modify a class attribute, it affects every
instance of the class.  For example, if we decide that <q>Jack of Diamonds</q>
should really be called <q>Jack of Swirly Whales,</q> we could do this:</p>

<span class="index" value="instance!object" />
<span class="index" value="object instance" />

<pre class="python-interpreter">
>>> card1.suits[1] = "Swirly Whales"
>>> print card1
Jack of Swirly Whales
</pre>

<p>The problem is that <em>all</em> of the Diamonds just became Swirly Whales:
</p>

<pre class="python-interpreter">
>>> print card2
3 of Swirly Whales
</pre>

<p>It is usually not a good idea to modify class attributes.</p>


<h2>Comparing cards</h2>
<a name="comparecard" />
<span class="index" value="operator!conditional" />
<span class="index" value="conditional operator" />

<p>For primitive types, there are conditional operators
(<code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>==</code>, etc.)
that compare values and determine when one is greater than, less than, or
equal to another.  For user-defined types, we can override the behavior of
the built-in operators by providing a method named <code>__cmp__</code>.  By
convention, <code>__cmp__</code> takes two parameters, <code>self</code> and
<code>other</code>, and returns 1 if the first object is greater, -1 if the
second object is greater, and 0 if they are equal to each other.</p>

<span class="index" value="override" />
<span class="index" value="operator overloading" />
<span class="index" value="ordering" />
<span class="index" value="complete ordering" />
<span class="index" value="partial ordering" />

<p>Some types are completely ordered, which means that you can compare any two
elements and tell which is bigger.  For example, the integers and the
floating-point numbers are completely ordered.  Some sets are unordered, which
means that there is no meaningful way to say that one element is bigger than
another.  For example, the fruits are unordered, which is why you cannot
compare apples and oranges.</p>

<p>The set of playing cards is partially ordered, which means that sometimes
you can compare cards and sometimes not.  For example, you know that the 3 of
Clubs is higher than the 2 of Clubs, and the 3 of Diamonds is higher than the 3 
of Clubs.  But which is better, the 3 of Clubs or the 2 of Diamonds?  One has a 
higher rank, but the other has a higher suit.</p>

<span class="index" value="comparable" />

<p>In order to make cards comparable, you have to decide which is more
important, rank or suit.  To be honest, the choice is arbitrary.  For the sake
of choosing, we will say that suit is more important, because a new deck of
cards comes sorted with all the Clubs together, followed by all the Diamonds,
and so on.</p>

<p>With that decided, we can write <code>__cmp__</code>:</p>

<pre class="python-interpreter">
def __cmp__(self, other):
    # check the suits
    if self.suit &gt; other.suit: return 1
    if self.suit &lt; other.suit: return -1
    # suits are the same... check ranks
    if self.rank &gt; other.rank: return 1
    if self.rank &lt; other.rank: return -1
    # ranks are the same... it's a tie
    return 0
</pre>

<p>In this ordering, Aces appear lower than Deuces (2s).</p>


<h2>Decks</h2>
<span class="index" value="list!of objects" />
<span class="index" value="object!list of" />
<span class="index" value="deck" />

<p>Now that we have objects to represent <code>Card</code>s, the next logical
step is to define a class to represent a <code>Deck</code>.  Of course, a deck
is made up of cards, so each <code>Deck</code> object will contain a list of
cards as an attribute.</p>

<span class="index" value="initialization method" />
<span class="index" value="method!initialization" />

<p>The following is a class definition for the <code>Deck</code> class.  The
initialization method creates the attribute <code>cards</code> and generates
the standard set of fifty-two cards:</p>

<span class="index" value="composition" />
<span class="index" value="loop!nested" />

<pre class="python">
class Deck:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cards = []
        for suit in range(4):
            for rank in range(1, 14):
                self.cards.append(Card(suit, rank))
</pre>

<p>The easiest way to populate the deck is with a nested loop.  The outer loop
enumerates the suits from 0 to 3.  The inner loop enumerates the ranks from 1
to 13.  Since the outer loop iterates four times, and the inner loop iterates
thirteen times, the total number of times the body is executed is fifty-two
(thirteen times four).  Each iteration creates a new instance of
<code>Card</code> with the current suit and rank, and appends that card to the
<code>cards</code> list.</p>

<p>The <code>append</code> method works on lists but not, of course, tuples.
</p>

<span class="index" value="append method" />
<span class="index" value="list method" />
<span class="index" value="method!list" />


<h2>Printing the deck</h2>
<a name="printdeck" />
<span class="index" value="printing!deck object" />

<p>As usual, when we define a new type of object we want a method that prints
the contents of an object.  To print a <code>Deck</code>, we traverse the list
and print each <code>Card</code>:</p>

<pre class="python">
class Deck:
    ...
    def print_deck(self):
        for card in self.cards:
            print card
</pre>

<p>Here, and from now on, the ellipsis (<code>...</code>) indicates that we
have omitted the other methods in the class.</p>

<p>As an alternative to <code>print_deck</code>, we could write a
<code>__str__</code> method for the <code>Deck</code> class.  The advantage of
<code>__str__</code> is that it is more flexible.  Rather than just printing
the contents of the object, it generates a string representation that other
parts of the program can manipulate before printing, or store for later use.
</p>

<p>Here is a version of <code>__str__</code> that returns a string
representation of a <code>Deck</code>.  To add a bit of pizzazz, it arranges
the cards in a cascade where each card is indented one space more than the
previous card:</p>

<pre class="python">
class Deck:
    ...
    def __str__(self):
        s = ""
        for i in range(len(self.cards)):
            s = s + " "*i + str(self.cards[i]) + "\n"
        return s
</pre>

<p>This example demonstrates several features.  First, instead of traversing
<code>self.cards</code> and assigning each card to a variable, we are using
<code>i</code> as a loop variable and an index into the list of cards.</p>

<p>Second, we are using the string multiplication operator to indent each card
by one more space than the last.  The expression <code>" "*i</code> yields a
number of spaces equal to the current value of <code>i</code>.</p>

<p>Third, instead of using the <code>print</code> command to print the cards,
we use the <code>str</code> function.  Passing an object as an argument to
<code>str</code> is equivalent to invoking the <code>__str__</code> method on
the object.</p>

<span class="index" value="accumulator" />

<p>Finally, we are using the variable <code>s</code> as an
<b>accumulator</b>.  Initially, <code>s</code> is the empty string.
Each time through the loop, a new string is generated and concatenated with the 
old value of <code>s</code> to get the new value.  When the loop ends,
<code>s</code> contains the complete string representation of the
<code>Deck</code>, which looks like this:</p>

<pre class="python-interpreter">
>>> deck = Deck()
>>> print deck
Ace of Clubs
 2 of Clubs
  3 of Clubs
   4 of Clubs
     5 of Clubs
       6 of Clubs
        7 of Clubs
         8 of Clubs
          9 of Clubs
           10 of Clubs
            Jack of Clubs
             Queen of Clubs
              King of Clubs
               Ace of Diamonds
</pre>

<p>And so on.  Even though the result appears on 52 lines, it is one long
string that contains newlines.</p>


<h2>Shuffling the deck</h2>
<span class="index" value="shuffle" />

<p>If a deck is perfectly shuffled, then any card is equally likely to appear
anywhere in the deck, and any location in the deck is equally likely to contain 
any card.</p>

<span class="index" value="random" />
<span class="index" value="randrange" />

<p>To shuffle the deck, we will use the <code>randrange</code> function from
the <code>random</code> module.  With two integer arguments, <code>a</code> and 
<code>b</code>, <code>randrange</code> chooses a random integer in the range
<code>a &lt;= x &lt; b</code>.  Since the upper bound is strictly less than
<code>b</code>, we can use the length of a list as the second parameter, and we 
are guaranteed to get a legal index.  For example, this expression chooses the
index of a random card in a deck:</p>

<pre class="python">
random.randrange(0, len(self.cards))
</pre>

<p>An easy way to shuffle the deck is by traversing the cards and swapping each 
card with a randomly chosen one.  It is possible that the card will be swapped
with itself, but that is fine.  In fact, if we precluded that possibility, the
order of the cards would be less than entirely random:</p>

<pre class="python">
class Deck:
    ...
    def shuffle(self):
        import random
        num_cards = len(self.cards)
        for i in range(num_cards):
            j = random.randrange(i, num_cards)
            self.cards[i], self.cards[j] = self.cards[j], self.cards[i]
</pre>

<p>Rather than assume that there are fifty-two cards in the deck, we get the
actual length of the list and store it in <code>num_cards</code>.</p>

<span class="index" value="swap" />
<span class="index" value="tuple assignment" />
<span class="index" value="assignment!tuple" />

<p>For each card in the deck, we choose a random card from among the cards that 
haven't been shuffled yet.  Then we swap the current card (<code>i</code>) with 
the selected card (<code>j</code>).  To swap the cards we use a tuple
assignment:</p>

<pre class="python">
self.cards[i], self.cards[j] = self.cards[j], self.cards[i]
</pre>


<h2>Removing and dealing cards</h2>
<span class="index" value="removing cards" />

<p>Another method that would be useful for the <code>Deck</code> class is
<code>remove</code>, which takes a card as a parameter, removes it, and
returns <code>True</code> if the card was in the deck and <code>False</code>
otherwise:</p>

<pre class="python">
class Deck:
    ...
    def remove(self, card):
        if card in self.cards:
            self.cards.remove(card)
            return True 
        else:
            return False 
</pre>

<p>The <code>in</code> operator returns <code>True</code> if the first operand
is in the second, which must be a list or a tuple.  If the first operand is an
object, Python uses the object's <code>__cmp__</code> method to determine
equality with items in the list.  Since the <code>__cmp__</code> in the
<code>Card</code> class checks for deep equality, the <code>remove</code>
method checks for deep equality.</p>

<span class="index" value="in operator" />
<span class="index" value="operator!in" />

<p>To deal cards, we want to remove and return the top card.  The list method
<code>pop</code> provides a convenient way to do that:</p>

<pre class="python">
class Deck:
    ...
    def pop(self):
        return self.cards.pop()
</pre>

<p>Actually, <code>pop</code> removes the <em>last</em> card in the list, so we 
are in effect dealing from the bottom of the deck.</p>

<span class="index" value="boolean function" />
<span class="index" value="function!boolean" />

<p>One more operation that we are likely to want is the boolean function
<code>is_empty</code>, which returns true if the deck contains no cards:</p>

<pre class="python">
class Deck:
    ...
    def is_empty(self):
        return (len(self.cards) == 0)
</pre>
