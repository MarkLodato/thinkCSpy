<h2>Object-oriented programming</h2>
<span class="index" value="object-oriented programming language" />
<span class="index" value="object-oriented programming" />

<p>
Python is an <b>object-oriented programming language</b>, which means that
it provides features that support <b>object-oriented programming</b>.
</p>

<p>
Object-oriented programming has its roots in the 1960s, but it wasn't until
the mid 1980s that it  became the main <b>programming paradigm</b> used in the
creation of new software.  It was developed as a way to handle the rapidly
increasing size and complexity of software systems, and to make it easier to
modify these large and complex systems over time.
</p>

<p>
Up to this point we have been writing programs using a <b>procedural
programming</b> paradigm.  In procedural programming the focus is on writing
functions or <em>procedures</em> which operate on data.   In object-oriented
programming the focus is on the creation of <b>objects</b> which contain
both data and functionality together.
</p>


<h2>User-defined compound types</h2>
<a name="point" />
<span class="index" value="compound data type" />
<span class="index" value="data type!compound" />
<span class="index" value="user-defined data type" />
<span class="index" value="data type!user-defined" />

<p>Having used some of Python's built-in types, we are ready to create a
user-defined type: the <code>Point</code>.</p>

<p>Consider the concept of a mathematical point.  In two dimensions, a point is 
two numbers (coordinates) that are treated collectively as a single object.  In 
mathematical notation, points are often written in parentheses with a comma
separating the coordinates. For example, <code>(0, 0)</code> represents the
origin, and <code>(x, y)</code> represents the point <code>x</code> units to
the right and <code>y</code> units up from the origin.</p>

<p>A natural way to represent a point in Python is with two floating-point
values.  The question, then, is how to group these two values into a compound
object.  The quick and dirty solution is to use a list or tuple, and for some
applications that might be the best choice.</p>

<span class="index" value="floating-point" />

<p>An alternative is to define a new user-defined compound type, also called a
<b>class</b>.  This approach involves a bit more effort, but it has
advantages that will be apparent soon.</p>

<p>A class definition looks like this:</p>

<pre class="python">
class Point:
    pass
</pre>

<p>Class definitions can appear anywhere in a program, but they are usually
near the beginning (after the <code>import</code> statements).  The syntax
rules for a class definition are the same as for other compound statements.
There is a header which begins with the keyword, <code>class</code>, followed
by the name of the class, and ending with a colon.
</p>

<p>This definition creates a new class called <code>Point</code>.  The
<b>pass</b> statement has no effect; it is only necessary because a
compound statement must have something in its body.</p>

<p>By creating the <code>Point</code> class, we created a new type, also called 
<code>Point</code>.  The members of this type are called <b>instances</b> of
the type or <b>objects</b>.  Creating a new instance is called
<b>instantiation</b>.  To instantiate a <code>Point</code> object, we call a
function named (you guessed it) <code>Point</code>:</p>

<span class="index" value="instance!object" />
<span class="index" value="object instance" />
<span class="index" value="instantiation" />

<pre class="python-interpreter">
>>> type(Point)
&lt;type 'classobj'>
>>> p = Point()
>>> type(p)
&lt;type 'instance'>
</pre>

<p>The variable <code>p</code> is assigned a reference to a new
<code>Point</code> object.  A function like <code>Point</code> that creates
new objects is called a <b>constructor</b>.</p>


<h2>Attributes</h2>
<span class="index" value="attribute" />

<p>We can add new data to an instance using dot notation:</p>

<pre class="python-interpreter">
>>> p.x = 3.0
>>> p.y = 4.0
</pre>

<p>This syntax is similar to the syntax for selecting a variable from a module, 
such as <code>math.pi</code> or <code>string.uppercase</code>.  Both modules
and instances create their own namespaces, and the syntax for accessing names
contained in each, called <b>attributes</b>, is the same.  In this case the
attribute we are selecting is a data item from an instance.</p>

<p>The following state diagram shows the result of these assignments:</p>

<img src="illustrations/point.png" />

<p>The variable <code>p</code> refers to a Point object, which contains two 
attributes.  Each attribute refers to a floating-point number.</p>

<p>We can read the value of an attribute using the same syntax:</p>

<pre class="python-interpreter">
>>> print p.y
4.0
>>> x = p.x
>>> print x
3.0
</pre>

<p>The expression <code>p.x</code> means, <q>Go to the object <code>p</code>
refers to and get the value of <code>x</code>.</q> In this case, we assign that 
value to a variable named <code>x</code>.  There is no conflict between the
variable <code>x</code> and the attribute <code>x</code>.  The purpose of dot
notation is to identify which variable you are referring to unambiguously.</p>

<p>You can use dot notation as part of any expression, so the following
statements are legal:</p>

<pre class="python">
print '(' + str(p.x) + ', ' + str(p.y) + ')'
distanceSquared = p.x * p.x + p.y * p.y
</pre>

<p>The first line outputs <code>(3.0, 4.0)</code>; the second line calculates
the value 25.0.</p>


<h2>The <b>initialization method</b> and <code>self</code></h2>
<span class="index" value="initialization method" />
<span class="index" value="instance!initialization" />
<span class="index" value="__init__" />

<p>Since our <code>Point</code> class is intended to represent two dimensional 
mathematical points, <em>all</em> point instances ought to have <code>x</code>
and <code>y</code> attributes, but that is not yet so with our
<code>Point</code> objects.</p>

<pre class="python-interpreter">
>>> p2 = Point()
>>> p2.x
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
AttributeError: Point instance has no attribute 'x'
>>>
</pre>

<p>To solve this problem we add an <b>initialization method</b> to our class.
</p>

<pre class="python">
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x=0, y=0):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y 
</pre>


<h2>The <code>__str__</code> method</h2>

<p>You might be tempted to print the value of <code>blank</code> itself:</p>

<pre class="python-interpreter">
>>> print blank
&lt;__main__.Point instance at 0xb7d951ac>
</pre>

<p>The result indicates that <code>blank</code> is an instance of the
<code>Point</code> class and it was defined in <code>__main__</code>.
<code>0xb7d951ac</code> is the unique identifier for this object, written in
hexadecimal (base 16).  This is probably not the most informative way to
display a <code>Point</code> object.  You will see how to change it shortly.
</p>

<span class="index" value="printing!object" />


<h2>Instances as parameters</h2>
<span class="index" value="instance" />
<span class="index" value="parameter" />

<p>You can pass an instance as a parameter in the usual way.  For example:</p>

<pre class="python">
def print_point(p):
    print '(' + str(p.x) + ', ' + str(p.y) + ')'
</pre>

<p><code>print_point</code> takes a point as an argument and displays it in
the standard format.  If you call <code>print_point(blank)</code>, the
output is <code>(3.0, 4.0)</code>.</p>


<h2>Sameness</h2>
<span class="index" value="sameness" />

<p>The meaning of the word <q>same</q> seems perfectly clear until you give
it some thought, and then you realize there is more to it than you expected.
</p>

<span class="index" value="ambiguity" />
<span class="index" value="natural language" />
<span class="index" value="language!" />

<p>For example, if you say, <q>Chris and I have the same car,</q> you mean
that his car and yours are the same make and model, but that they are two
different cars.  If you say, <q>Chris and I have the same mother,</q>
you mean that his mother and yours are the same person.
</p>

<p>When you talk about objects, there is a similar ambiguity.  For example, if
two <code>Point</code>s are the same, does that mean they contain the same data 
(coordinates) or that they are actually the same object?</p>

<p>To find out if two references refer to the same object, use the
<code>==</code> operator.  For example:</p> 

<pre class="python-interpreter">
>>> p1 = Point()
>>> p1.x = 3
>>> p1.y = 4
>>> p2 = Point()
>>> p2.x = 3
>>> p2.y = 4
>>> p1 == p2
False
</pre>

<p>Even though <code>p1</code> and <code>p2</code> contain the same coordinates,
they are not the same object.  If we assign <code>p1</code> to <code>p2</code>, 
then the two variables are aliases of the same object:</p>

<pre class="python-interpreter">
>>> p2 = p1
>>> p1 == p2
True
</pre>

<p>This type of equality is called <b>shallow equality</b> because
it compares only the references, not the contents of the objects.</p>

<span class="index" value="equality" />
<span class="index" value="identity" />
<span class="index" value="shallow equality" />
<span class="index" value="deep equality" />

<p>To compare the contents of the objects---<b>deep equality</b>---we
can write a function called <code>same_point</code>:</p>

<pre class="python">
def same_point(p1, p2):
    return (p1.x == p2.x) and (p1.y == p2.y)
</pre>

<p>Now if we create two different objects that contain the same data, we can
use <code>same_point</code> to find out if they represent the same point.</p>

<pre class="python-interpreter">
>>> p1 = Point()
>>> p1.x = 3
>>> p1.y = 4
>>> p2 = Point()
>>> p2.x = 3
>>> p2.y = 4
>>> same_point(p1, p2)
True
</pre>

<p>Of course, if the two variables refer to the same object, they have both
shallow and deep equality.</p>


<h2>Rectangles</h2>
<span class="index" value="rectangle" />

<p>Let's say that we want a class to represent a rectangle.  The question
is, what information do we have to provide in order to specify a rectangle? To
keep things simple, assume that the rectangle is oriented either vertically or
horizontally, never at an angle.</p>

<p>There are a few possibilities: we could specify the center of the rectangle
(two coordinates) and its size (width and height); or we could specify one of
the corners and the size; or we could specify two opposing corners.  A
conventional choice is to specify the upper-left corner of the rectangle and
the size.</p>

<p>Again, we'll define a new class:</p>

<pre class="python">
class Rectangle:
    pass
</pre>

<p>And instantiate it:</p>

<pre class="python">
box = Rectangle()
box.width = 100.0
box.height = 200.0
</pre>

<p>This code creates a new <code>Rectangle</code> object with two
floating-point attributes.  To specify the upper-left corner, we can embed an
object within an object!</p>

<pre class="python">
box.corner = Point()
box.corner.x = 0.0;
box.corner.y = 0.0;
</pre>

<p>The dot operator composes.  The expression <code>box.corner.x</code> means,
<q>Go to the object <code>box</code> refers to and select the attribute named
<code>corner</code>; then go to that object and select the attribute named
<code>x</code>.</q></p>

<p>The figure shows the state of this object:</p>

<img src="illustrations/rectangle.png" />

<h2>Instances as return values</h2>
<span class="index" value="instance" />
<span class="index" value="return value" />

<p>Functions can return instances.  For example, <code>find_center</code>
takes a <code>Rectangle</code> as an argument and returns a <code>Point</code>
that contains the coordinates of the center of the <code>Rectangle</code>:</p>

<pre class="python">
def find_center(box):
    p = Point()
    p.x = box.corner.x + box.width/2.0
    p.y = box.corner.y - box.height/2.0
    return p
</pre>

<p>To call this function, pass <code>box</code> as an argument and assign the
result to a variable:</p>

<pre class="python-interpreter">
>>> center = find_center(box)
>>> print_point(center)
(50.0, 100.0)
</pre>


<h2>Objects are mutable</h2>
<span class="index" value="object!mutable" />
<span class="index" value="mutable!object" />

<p>We can change the state of an object by making an assignment to one of its
attributes.  For example, to change the size of a rectangle without changing
its position, we could modify the values of <code>width</code> and
<code>height</code>:</p>

<pre class="python">
box.width = box.width + 50
box.height = box.height + 100
</pre>

<p>We could encapsulate this code in a method and generalize it to grow the
rectangle by any amount:</p>

<span class="index" value="encapsulation" />
<span class="index" value="generalization" />

<pre class="python">
def grow_rect(box, dwidth, dheight) :
    box.width = box.width + dwidth
    box.height = box.height + dheight
</pre>

<p>The variables <code>dwidth</code> and <code>dheight</code> indicate how much 
the rectangle should grow in each direction.  Invoking this method has the
effect of modifying the <code>Rectangle</code> that is passed as an argument.
</p>

<p>For example, we could create a new <code>Rectangle</code> named
<code>bob</code> and pass it to <code>grow_rect</code>:</p>

<pre class="python-interpreter">
>>> bob = Rectangle()
>>> bob.width = 100.0
>>> bob.height = 200.0
>>> bob.corner = Point()
>>> bob.corner.x = 0.0;
>>> bob.corner.y = 0.0;
>>> grow_rect(bob, 50, 100)
</pre>

<p>While <code>grow_rect</code> is running, the parameter <code>box</code> is an
alias for <code>bob</code>.  Any changes made to <code>box</code> also affect
<code>bob</code>.</p>


<h2>Copying</h2>
<a name="embedded" />
<span class="index" value="aliasing" />
<span class="index" value="copying" />
<span class="index" value="copy module" />
<span class="index" value="module!copy" />

<p>Aliasing can make a program difficult to read because changes made in one
place might have unexpected effects in another place.  It is hard to keep track 
of all the variables that might refer to a given object.</p>

<p>Copying an object is often an alternative to aliasing.  The <code>copy</code>
module contains a function called <code>copy</code> that can duplicate any
object:</p>

<pre class="python-interpreter">
>>> import copy
>>> p1 = Point()
>>> p1.x = 3
>>> p1.y = 4
>>> p2 = copy.copy(p1)
>>> p1 == p2
False
>>> same_point(p1, p2)
True
</pre>

<p>Once we import the <code>copy</code> module, we can use the <code>copy</code>
method to make a new <code>Point</code>.  <code>p1</code> and <code>p2</code>
are not the same point, but they contain the same data.</p>

<p>To copy a simple object like a <code>Point</code>, which doesn't contain any 
embedded objects, <code>copy</code> is sufficient.  This is called
<b>shallow copying</b>.</p>

<p>For something like a <code>Rectangle</code>, which contains a reference
to a <code>Point</code>, <code>copy</code> doesn't do quite the right thing.
It copies the reference to the <code>Point</code> object, so both the old
<code>Rectangle</code> and the new one refer to a single <code>Point</code>.
</p>

<span class="index" value="embedded reference" />
<span class="index" value="reference!embedded" />

<p>If we create a box, <code>b1</code>, in the usual way and then make a copy,
<code>b2</code>, using <code>copy</code>, the resulting state diagram looks
like this:</p>

<img src="illustrations/rectangle2.png" />

<p>This is almost certainly not what we want.  In this case, invoking
<code>grow_rect</code> on one of the <code>Rectangles</code> would not affect
the other, but invoking <code>move_rect</code> on either would affect both!
This behavior is confusing and error-prone.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the <code>copy</code> module contains a method named
<code>deepcopy</code> that copies not only the object but also any embedded
objects.  You will not be surprised to learn that this operation is called a
<b>deep copy</b>.</p>

<pre class="python-interpreter">
>>> b2 = copy.deepcopy(b1)
</pre>

<p>Now <code>b1</code> and <code>b2</code> are completely separate objects.</p>

<p>We can use <code>deepcopy</code> to rewrite <code>grow_rect</code> so that
instead of modifying an existing <code>Rectangle</code>, it creates a new
<code>Rectangle</code> that has the same location as the old one but new
dimensions:</p>

<pre class="python">
def grow_rect(box, dwidth, dheight):
    import copy
    new_box = copy.deepcopy(box)
    new_box.width = new_box.width + dwidth
    new_box.height = new_box.height + dheight
    return new_box
</pre>
