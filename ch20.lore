<p>This chapter presents two ADTs: the Queue and the Priority Queue.  In real
life, a <b>queue</b> is a line of customers waiting for service of
some kind.  In most cases, the first customer in line is the next customer to
be served.  There are exceptions, though.  At airports, customers whose flights 
are leaving soon are sometimes taken from the middle of the queue.  At
supermarkets, a polite customer might let someone with only a few items go
first.</p>

<p>The rule that determines who goes next is called the
<b>queueing policy</b>.  The simplest queueing policy is called
<b>FIFO</b>, for <q>first-in-first-out.</q>  The most general
queueing policy is <b>priority queueing</b>, in which each customer
is assigned a priority and the customer with the highest priority goes first,
regardless of the order of arrival.  We say this is the most general policy
because the priority can be based on anything: what time a flight leaves; how
many groceries the customer has; or how important the customer is.  Of course,
not all queueing policies are <q>fair,</q> but fairness is in the eye of the
beholder.</p>

<p>The Queue ADT and the Priority Queue ADT have the same set of operations.
The difference is in the semantics of the operations: a queue uses the FIFO
policy; and a priority queue (as the name suggests) uses the priority queueing
policy.</p>


<h2>The Queue ADT</h2>
<span class="index" value="ADT!Queue" />
<span class="index" value="Queue ADT" />
<span class="index" value="implementation!Queue" />
<span class="index" value="queue!List implementation" />

<p>The Queue ADT is defined by the following operations:</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>__init__</code>:</dt>
<dd>Initialize a new empty queue.</dd>

<dt><code>insert</code>:</dt>
<dd>Add a new item to the queue.</dd>

<dt><code>remove</code>:</dt>
<dd>Remove and return an item from the queue.  The item that is returned is the 
first one that was added.</dd>

<dt><code>isEmpty</code>:</dt>
<dd>Check whether the queue is empty.</dd>
</dl>


<h2>Linked Queue</h2>
<span class="index" value="linked queue" />
<span class="index" value="queue!linked implementation" />

<p>The first implementation of the Queue ADT we will look at is called a
<b>linked queue</b> because it is made up of linked <code>Node</code> 
objects.  Here is the class definition:</p>

<pre class="python">
class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.length = 0
        self.head = None
 
    def isEmpty(self):
        return (self.length == 0)
 
    def insert(self, cargo):
        node = Node(cargo)
        node.next = None
        if self.head == None:
            # if list is empty the new node goes first
            self.head = node
        else:
            # find the last node in the list
            last = self.head
            while last.next: last = last.next
            # append the new node
            last.next = node
        self.length = self.length + 1
 
    def remove(self):
        cargo = self.head.cargo
        self.head = self.head.next
        self.length = self.length - 1
        return cargo
</pre>

<p>The methods <code>isEmpty</code> and <code>remove</code> are identical to
the <code>LinkedList</code> methods <code>isEmpty</code> and
<code>removeFirst</code>.  The <code>insert</code> method is new and a bit
more complicated.</p>

<p>We want to insert new items at the end of the list.  If the queue is empty,
we just set <code>head</code> to refer to the new node.</p>

<p>Otherwise, we traverse the list to the last node and tack the new node on
the end.  We can identify the last node because its <code>next</code> attribute 
is <code>None</code>.</p>

<p>There are two invariants for a properly formed <code>Queue</code> object.
The value of <code>length</code> should be the number of nodes in the queue,
and the last node should have <code>next</code> equal to <code>None</code>.
Convince yourself that this method preserves both invariants.</p>


<h2>Performance characteristics</h2>
<span class="index" value="performance" />

<p>Normally when we invoke a method, we are not concerned with the details of
its implementation.  But there is one <q>detail</q> we might want to know---the 
performance characteristics of the method.  How long does it take, and how does 
the run time change as the number of items in the collection increases?</p>

<p>First look at <code>remove</code>.  There are no loops or function calls
here, suggesting that the runtime of this method is the same every time.  Such
a method is called a <b>constant-time</b> operation.  In reality, the 
method might be slightly faster when the list is empty since it skips the body
of the conditional, but that difference is not significant.</p>

<span class="index" value="constant time" />

<p>The performance of <code>insert</code> is very different.  In the general
case, we have to traverse the list to find the last element.</p>

<p>This traversal takes time proportional to the length of the list.  Since the 
runtime is a linear function of the length, this method is called
<b>linear time</b>.  Compared to constant time, that's very bad.</p>

<span class="index" value="linear time" />


<h2>Improved Linked Queue</h2>
<span class="index" value="queue!improved implementation" />
<span class="index" value="improved queue" />

<p>We would like an implementation of the Queue ADT that can perform all
operations in constant time.  One way to do that is to modify the Queue class
so that it maintains a reference to both the first and the last node, as shown
in the figure:</p>

<img src="illustrations/queue1.png" />

<p>The <code>ImprovedQueue</code> implementation looks like this:</p>

<pre class="python">
class ImprovedQueue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.length = 0
        self.head   = None
        self.last   = None
 
    def isEmpty(self):
        return (self.length == 0)
</pre>

<p>So far, the only change is the attribute <code>last</code>. It is used in
<code>insert</code> and <code>remove</code> methods:</p>

<pre class="python">
class ImprovedQueue:
    ...
    def insert(self, cargo):
        node = Node(cargo)
        node.next = None
        if self.length == 0:
            # if list is empty, the new node is head and last
            self.head = self.last = node
        else:
            # find the last node
            last = self.last
            # append the new node
            last.next = node
            self.last = node
        self.length = self.length + 1
</pre>

<p>Since <code>last</code> keeps track of the last node, we don't have to
search for it.  As a result, this method is constant time.</p>

<p>There is a price to pay for that speed.  We have to add a special case to
<code>remove</code> to set <code>last</code> to <code>None</code> when the last 
node is removed:</p>

<pre class="python">
class ImprovedQueue:
    ...
    def remove(self):
        cargo     = self.head.cargo
        self.head = self.head.next
        self.length = self.length - 1
        if self.length == 0:
            self.last = None
        return cargo
</pre>

<p>This implementation is more complicated than the Linked Queue implementation,
and it is more difficult to demonstrate that it is correct.  The advantage is
that we have achieved the goal---both <code>insert</code> and
<code>remove</code> are constant-time operations.</p>


<h2>Priority queue</h2>
<span class="index" value="priority queue!ADT" />
<span class="index" value="ADT!Priority Queue" />

<p>The Priority Queue ADT has the same interface as the Queue ADT, but
different semantics.  Again, the interface is:</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>__init__</code>:</dt>
<dd>Initialize a new empty queue.</dd>

<dt><code>insert</code>:</dt>
<dd>Add a new item to the queue.</dd>

<dt><code>remove</code>:</dt>
<dd>Remove and return an item from the queue.  The item that is returned is the 
one with the highest priority.</dd>

<dt><code>isEmpty</code>:</dt>
<dd>Check whether the queue is empty.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The semantic difference is that the item that is removed from the queue is
not necessarily the first one that was added.  Rather, it is the item in the
queue that has the highest priority.  What the priorities are and how they
compare to each other are not specified by the Priority Queue implementation.
It depends on which items are in the queue.</p>

<p>For example, if the items in the queue have names, we might choose them in
alphabetical order.  If they are bowling scores, we might go from highest to
lowest, but if they are golf scores, we would go from lowest to highest.  As
long as we can compare the items in the queue, we can find and remove the one
with the highest priority.</p>

<p>This implementation of Priority Queue has as an attribute a Python list that
contains the items in the queue.</p>

<pre class="python">
class PriorityQueue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []
 
    def isEmpty(self):
        return self.items == []
 
    def insert(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)
</pre>

<p>The initialization method, <code>isEmpty</code>, and <code>insert</code> are 
all veneers on list operations.  The only interesting method is
<code>remove</code>:</p>

<pre class="python">
class PriorityQueue:
    ...
    def remove(self):
        maxi = 0
        for i in range(1, len(self.items)):
            if self.items[i] &gt; self.items[maxi]: maxi = i
        item = self.items[maxi]
        self.items[maxi:maxi+1] = []
        return item
</pre>

<p>At the beginning of each iteration, <code>maxi</code> holds the index of the
biggest item (highest priority) we have seen <em>so far</em>.  Each time
through the loop, the program compares the <code>i</code>-eth item to the
champion.  If the new item is bigger, the value of <code>maxi</code> if set to
<code>i</code>.</p>

<span class="index" value="traverse" />

<p>When the <code>for</code> statement completes, <code>maxi</code> is the
index of the biggest item.  This item is removed from the list and returned.
</p>

<p>Let's test the implementation:</p>

<pre class="python-interpreter">
>>> q = PriorityQueue()
>>> q.insert(11)
>>> q.insert(12)
>>> q.insert(14)
>>> q.insert(13)
>>> while not q.isEmpty(): print q.remove()
14
13
12
11
</pre>

<p>If the queue contains simple numbers or strings, they are removed in
numerical or alphabetical order, from highest to lowest.  Python can find the
biggest integer or string because it can compare them using the built-in
comparison operators.</p>

<p>If the queue contains an object type, it has to provide a
<code>__cmp__</code> method.  When <code>remove</code> uses the
<code>&gt;</code> operator to compare items, it invokes the <code>__cmp__</code>
for one of the items and passes the other as a parameter.  As long as the
<code>__cmp__</code> method works correctly, the Priority Queue will work.</p>


<h2>The <code>Golfer</code> class</h2>
<span class="index" value="Golfer" />
<span class="index" value="class!Golfer" />
<span class="index" value="priority" />
<span class="index" value="operator overloading" />
<span class="index" value="overloading!operator" />

<p>As an example of an object with an unusual definition of priority, let's
implement a class called <code>Golfer</code> that keeps track of the names and
scores of golfers.  As usual, we start by defining <code>__init__</code> and
<code>__str__</code>:</p>

<pre class="python">
class Golfer:
    def __init__(self, name, score):
        self.name = name
        self.score= score
 
    def __str__(self):
        return "%-16s: %d" % (self.name, self.score)
</pre>

<p><code>__str__</code> uses the format operator to put the names and scores in 
neat columns.</p>

<span class="index" value="format operator" />
<span class="index" value="operator!format" />

<p>Next we define a version of <code>__cmp__</code> where the lowest score gets 
highest priority.  As always, <code>__cmp__</code> returns 1 if
<code>self</code> is <q>greater than</q> <code>other</code>, -1 if
<code>self</code> is <q>less than</q> other, and 0 if they are equal.</p>

<pre class="python">
class Golfer:
    ...
    def __cmp__(self, other):
        if self.score &lt; other.score: return  1   # less is more
        if self.score &gt; other.score: return -1
        return 0
</pre>

<p>Now we are ready to test the priority queue with the <code>Golfer</code>
class:</p>

<pre class="python-interpreter">
>>> tiger = Golfer("Tiger Woods",    61)
>>> phil  = Golfer("Phil Mickelson", 72)
>>> hal   = Golfer("Hal Sutton",     69)
>>>
>>> pq = PriorityQueue()
>>> pq.insert(tiger)
>>> pq.insert(phil)
>>> pq.insert(hal)
>>> while not pq.isEmpty(): print pq.remove()
   Tiger Woods    : 61
   Hal Sutton     : 69
   Phil Mickelson : 72
</pre>
