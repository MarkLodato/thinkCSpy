<h1>Case Study: Catch</h1>


<h2>Creating a main loop</h2>

<p>Looping is also very useful for enabling users to control how many times
parts of a program are executed.</p>

<pre class='python'>
def play_game():
    print "I'm playing... Oh what fun!"

choice = 'y' 

while choice == 'y':
    play_game()
    choice = raw_input("Would you like to play again? (y/n): ")
</pre>

<p>The variable <code>choice</code> is initialized to <code>'y'</code>.
This makes the condition of the while loop true the first time it is evaluated,
and assures that users get to play the game at least once.  After the game
finishes (and we assume the call to <code>play_game()</code> would do something
more then print a message), users will be asked if they would like to play
again.  As long as they keep answering with 'y', they can continue playing.</p>


<h2>Using <code>while</code> to move a ball</h2>

<p><code>while</code> statements can be used with <code>GASP</code> to add
motion to a program.  The program below moves a black ball across an 800x600
pixel graphics canvas:</p>

<pre class='python'>
from gasp import *

begin_graphics(800, 600, background=color.yellow)

x = 5
y = 5
ball = Circle((x, y), 10, filled=True)
dx = 4
dy = 3

while x &lt; 795:
    x = x + dx
    y = y + dy
    move_to(ball, (x, y))
    sleep(0.02)

end_graphics()
</pre>

<p>As the ball moves across the screen, you will see a graphics window that
looks like this:</p>

<img src="illustrations/gasp03.png" />

<p>
Trace the first few iterations of this program to be sure you see what is
happening to the variables <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.
</p>

<p>
Some new things to learn about GASP from this example:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>begin_graphics</code> can take arguments for width, height,
  and background color of the graphics canvas.</li>

  <li>Adding <code>filled=True</code> to <code>Circle(...)</code> makes
  the resulting circle solid.</li>

  <li><code>ball = Circle</code> stores the circle (we will talk later
  about what a circle actually is) in a variable named <code>ball</code>
  so that it can be referenced later.</li>

  <li>The <code>move_to</code> function in GASP allows a programmer to
  pass in a shape (the ball in this case) and a location, and moves the
  shape to that location.</li>

  <li>The <code>sleep</code> function takes a time value in seconds as
  an argument and pauses the program for that length of time.</li>
</ul>
