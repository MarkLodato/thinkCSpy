is <b>inheritance</b>.  Inheritance is the ability to define a new
class that is a modified version of an existing class.</p><p>The primary advantage of this feature is that you can add new methods to a
class without modifying the existing class.  It is called <q>inheritance</q>
because the new class inherits all of the methods of the existing class.
Extending this metaphor, the existing class is sometimes called the
<b>parent</b> class.  The new class may be called the
<b>child</b> class or sometimes <q>subclass.</q></p><a name="index06"></a><p>Inheritance is a powerful feature.  Some programs that would be complicated
without inheritance can be written concisely and simply with it.  Also,
inheritance can facilitate code reuse, since you can customize the behavior of
parent classes without having to modify them.  In some cases, the inheritance
structure reflects the natural structure of the problem, which makes the
program easier to understand.</p><p>On the other hand, inheritance can make programs difficult to read.  When a
method is invoked, it is sometimes not clear where to find its definition.
The relevant code may be scattered among several modules.  Also, many of the
things that can be done using inheritance can be done as elegantly (or more so) 
without it.  If the natural structure of the problem does not lend itself to
inheritance, this style of programming can do more harm than good.</p><p>In this chapter we will demonstrate the use of inheritance as part of a
program that plays the card game Old Maid.  One of our goals is to write code
that could be reused to implement other card games.</p><h2>16.2 A hand of cards<a name="auto1"></a></h2><p>For almost any card game, we need to represent a hand of cards.  A hand is
similar to a deck, of course.  Both are made up of a set of cards, and both
require operations like adding and removing cards.  Also, we might like the
ability to shuffle both decks and hands.</p><p>A hand is also different from a deck.  Depending on the game being played,
we might want to perform some operations on hands that don't make sense for a
deck.  For example, in poker we might classify a hand (straight, flush, etc.)
or compare it with another hand.  In bridge, we might want to compute a score
for a hand in order to make a bid.</p><p>This situation suggests the use of inheritance.  If <code>Hand</code> is a
subclass of <code>Deck</code>, it will have all the methods of
<code>Deck</code>, and new methods can be added.</p><a name="index07"></a><a name="index08"></a><p>In the class definition, the name of the parent class appears in
parentheses:</p><pre class="python">
<span class="py-src-keyword">class</span> <span class="py-src-identifier">Hand</span>(<span class="py-src-parameter">Deck</span>):
    <span class="py-src-keyword">pass</span>
</pre><p>This statement indicates that the new <code>Hand</code> class inherits from
the existing <code>Deck</code> class.</p><p>The <code>Hand</code> constructor initializes the attributes for the hand,
which are <code>name</code> and <code>cards</code>.  The string
<code>name</code> identifies this hand, probably by the name of the player that 
holds it.  The name is an optional parameter with the empty string as a default 
value.  <code>cards</code> is the list of cards in the hand, initialized to the 
empty list:</p><pre class="python">
<span class="py-src-keyword">class</span> <span class="py-src-identifier">Hand</span>(<span class="py-src-parameter">Deck</span>):
    <span class="py-src-keyword">def</span> <span class="py-src-identifier">__init__</span>(<span class="py-src-parameter">self</span>, <span class="py-src-parameter">name</span>=<span class="py-src-string">&quot;&quot;</span>):
       <span class="py-src-variable">self</span>.<span class="py-src-variable">cards</span> = []
       <span class="py-src-variable">self</span>.<span class="py-src-variable">name</span> = <span class="py-src-variable">name</span>
</pre><p>For just about any card game, it is necessary to add and remove cards from
the deck.  Removing cards is already taken care of, since <code>Hand</code>
inherits <code>remove</code> from <code>Deck</code>.  But we have to write
<code>add</code>:</p><pre class="python">
<span class="py-src-keyword">class</span> <span class="py-src-identifier">Hand</span>(<span class="py-src-parameter">Deck</span>):
    ...
    <span class="py-src-keyword">def</span> <span class="py-src-identifier">add</span>(<span class="py-src-parameter">self</span>,<span class="py-src-parameter">card</span>):
        <span class="py-src-variable">self</span>.<span class="py-src-variable">cards</span>.<span class="py-src-variable">append</span>(<span class="py-src-variable">card</span>)
</pre><p>Again, the ellipsis indicates that we have omitted other methods.  The list
<code>append</code> method adds the new card to the end of the list of cards.
</p><h2>16.3 Dealing cards<a name="auto2"></a></h2><a name="index09"></a><p>Now that we have a <code>Hand</code> class, we want to deal cards from the
<code>Deck</code> into hands.  It is not immediately obvious whether this
method should go in the <code>Hand</code> class or in the <code>Deck</code>
class, but since it operates on a single deck and (possibly) several hands,
it is more natural to put it in <code>Deck</code>.</p><p><code>deal</code> should be fairly general, since different games will have
different requirements.  We may want to deal out the entire deck at once or add 
one card to each hand.</p><p><code>deal</code> takes two parameters, a list (or tuple) of hands and the
total number of cards to deal.  If there are not enough cards in the deck, the
method deals out all of the cards and stops:</p><pre class="python">
<span class="py-src-keyword">class</span> <span class="py-src-identifier">Deck</span> :
    ...
    <span class="py-src-keyword">def</span> <span class="py-src-identifier">deal</span>(<span class="py-src-parameter">self</span>, <span class="py-src-parameter">hands</span>, <span class="py-src-parameter">num_cards</span>=<span class="py-src-number">999</span>):
        <span class="py-src-variable">num_hands</span> = <span class="py-src-variable">len</span>(<span class="py-src-variable">hands</span>)

            <span class="py-src-keyword">if</span> <span class="py-src-variable">self</span>.<span class="py-src-variable">is_empty</span>(): <span class="py-src-keyword">break</span>   <span class="py-src-comment"># break if out of cards</span>
            <span class="py-src-variable">card</span> = <span class="py-src-variable">self</span>.<span class="py-src-variable">pop</span>()           <span class="py-src-comment"># take the top card</span>
            <span class="py-src-variable">hand</span> = <span class="py-src-variable">hands</span>[<span class="py-src-variable">i</span> % <span class="py-src-variable">num_hands</span>] <span class="py-src-comment"># whose turn is next?</span>
            <span class="py-src-variable">hand</span>.<span class="py-src-variable">add</span>(<span class="py-src-variable">card</span>)              <span class="py-src-comment"># add the card to the hand</span>
</pre><p>The second parameter, <code>num_cards</code>, is optional; the default is a
large number, which effectively means that all of the cards in the deck will
get dealt.</p><a name="index10"></a><a name="index11"></a><p>The loop variable <code>i</code> goes from 0 to <code>nCards-1</code>.  Each
time through the loop, a card is removed from the deck using the list method
<code>pop</code>, which removes and returns the last item in the list.</p><a name="index12"></a><a name="index13"></a><p>The modulus operator (<code>%</code>) allows us to deal cards in a round
robin (one card at a time to each hand).  When <code>i</code> is equal to the
number of hands in the list, the expression <code>i % nHands</code> wraps
around to the beginning of the list (index 0).</p><h2>16.4 Printing a Hand<a name="auto3"></a></h2><a name="index14"></a><p>To print the contents of a hand, we can take advantage of the
<code>printDeck</code> and <code>__str__</code> methods inherited from
<code>Deck</code>.  For example:</p><pre class="python-interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; deck = Deck()
&gt;&gt;&gt; deck.shuffle()
&gt;&gt;&gt; hand = Hand(&quot;frank&quot;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; deck.deal([hand], 5)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print hand
Hand frank contains
2 of Spades
 3 of Spades
  4 of Spades
   Ace of Hearts
    9 of Clubs
</pre><p>It's not a great hand, but it has the makings of a straight flush.</p><a name="index15"></a><p>Although it is convenient to inherit the existing methods, there is
additional information in a <code>Hand</code> object we might want to include
when we print one.  To do that, we can provide a <code>__str__</code> method in 
the <code>Hand</code> class that overrides the one in the <code>Deck</code>
class:</p><pre class="python">
<span class="py-src-keyword">class</span> <span class="py-src-identifier">Hand</span>(<span class="py-src-parameter">Deck</span>)
    ...
    <span class="py-src-keyword">def</span> <span class="py-src-identifier">__str__</span>(<span class="py-src-parameter">self</span>):
        <span class="py-src-variable">s</span> = <span class="py-src-string">&quot;Hand &quot;</span> + <span class="py-src-variable">self</span>.<span class="py-src-variable">name</span>
        <span class="py-src-keyword">if</span> <span class="py-src-variable">self</span>.<span class="py-src-variable">is_empty</span>():
            <span class="py-src-variable">s</span> = <span class="py-src-variable">s</span> + <span class="py-src-string">&quot; is empty\n&quot;</span>
        <span class="py-src-keyword">else</span>:
            <span class="py-src-variable">s</span> = <span class="py-src-variable">s</span> + <span class="py-src-string">&quot; contains\n&quot;</span>
        <span class="py-src-keyword">return</span> <span class="py-src-variable">s</span> + <span class="py-src-variable">Deck</span>.<span class="py-src-variable">__str__</span>(<span class="py-src-variable">self</span>)
</pre><p>Initially, <code>s</code> is a string that identifies the hand.  If the hand
is empty, the program appends the words <code>is empty</code> and returns
<code>s</code>.</p><p>Otherwise, the program appends the word <code>contains</code> and the string
representation of the <code>Deck</code>, computed by invoking the
<code>__str__</code> method in the <code>Deck</code> class on <code>self</code>.
</p><p>It may seem odd to send <code>self</code>, which refers to the current
<code>Hand</code>, to a <code>Deck</code> method, until you remember that a
<code>Hand</code> is a kind of <code>Deck</code>.  <code>Hand</code> objects
can do everything <code>Deck</code> objects can, so it is legal to send a
<code>Hand</code> to a <code>Deck</code> method.</p><a name="index16"></a><a name="index17"></a><a name="index18"></a><p>In general, it is always legal to use an instance of a subclass in place of
an instance of a parent class.</p><h2>16.5 The <code>CardGame</code> class<a name="auto4"></a></h2><p>The <code>CardGame</code> class takes care of some basic chores common to all
games, such as creating the deck and shuffling it:</p><pre class="python">
<span class="py-src-keyword">class</span> <span class="py-src-identifier">CardGame</span>:
    <span class="py-src-keyword">def</span> <span class="py-src-identifier">__init__</span>(<span class="py-src-parameter">self</span>):
        <span class="py-src-variable">self</span>.<span class="py-src-variable">deck</span> = <span class="py-src-variable">Deck</span>()
        <span class="py-src-variable">self</span>.<span class="py-src-variable">deck</span>.<span class="py-src-variable">shuffle</span>()
</pre><p>This is the first case we have seen where the initialization method performs 
a significant computation, beyond initializing attributes.</p><p>To implement specific games, we can inherit from <code>CardGame</code> and
add features for the new game.  As an example, we'll write a simulation of Old
Maid.</p><p>The object of Old Maid is to get rid of cards in your hand.  You do this by
matching cards by rank and color.  For example, the 4 of Clubs matches the 4 of 
Spades since both suits are black.  The Jack of Hearts matches the Jack of
Diamonds since both are red.</p><p>To begin the game, the Queen of Clubs is removed from the deck so that the
Queen of Spades has no match.  The fifty-one remaining cards are dealt to the
players in a round robin.  After the deal, all players match and discard as
many cards as possible.</p><p>When no more matches can be made, play begins.  In turn, each player picks a 
card (without looking) from the closest neighbor to the left who still has
cards.  If the chosen card matches a card in the player's hand, the pair is
removed.  Otherwise, the card is added to the player's hand.  Eventually all
possible matches are made, leaving only the Queen of Spades in the loser's hand.
</p><p>In our computer simulation of the game, the computer plays all hands.
Unfortunately, some nuances of the real game are lost.  In a real game, the
player with the Old Maid goes to some effort to get their neighbor to pick that 
card, by displaying it a little more prominently, or perhaps failing to display 
it more prominently, or even failing to fail to display that card more
prominently.  The computer simply picks a neighbor's card at random.</p><h2>16.6 <code>OldMaidHand</code> class<a name="auto5"></a></h2><a name="index19"></a><p>A hand for playing Old Maid requires some abilities beyond the general
abilities of a <code>Hand</code>.  We will define a new class,
<code>OldMaidHand</code>, that inherits from <code>Hand</code> and provides an
additional method called <code>remove_matches</code>:</p><pre class="python">

</pre><p>We start by making a copy of the list of cards, so that we can traverse the
copy while removing cards from the original.  Since <code>self.cards</code> is
modified in the loop, we don't want to use it to control the traversal.
Python can get quite confused if it is traversing a list that is changing!</p><a name="index20"></a><p>For each card in the hand, we figure out what the matching card is and go
looking for it.  The match card has the same rank and the other suit of the
same color.  The expression <code>3 - card.suit</code> turns a Club (suit 0)
into a Spade (suit 3) and a Diamond (suit 1) into a Heart (suit 2).  You should 
satisfy yourself that the opposite operations also work.  If the match card is
also in the hand, both cards are removed.</p><p>The following example demonstrates how to use <code>remove_matches</code>:</p><pre class="python-interpreter">

does nothing and returns 0.</p><p>Otherwise, a turn consists of finding the first player on the left that has
cards, taking one card from the neighbor, and checking for matches.  Before
returning, the cards in the hand are shuffled so that the next player's choice
is random.</p><p>The method <code>find_neighbor</code> starts with the player to the immediate
