Setting up:
<ul><li>Starting in your home directory, you can make a new directory for
  this activity by typing the following at the unix prompt:
  <pre class="shell">
  $ mkdir thinkcs
  $ mkdir thinkcs/chap03 
  </pre>
  and then use cd to move into it.</li><li>Download <a href="lib/world.py">world.py</a> into your
  <code>chap03</code> directory for the exercises that follow.</li><li>Run the program by typing: <code>python world.py</code>
  in the <code>chap03</code> directory. (note: running:
  <pre class="shell">
  $ python world.py &amp;
  </pre>
  will give you the prompt back so you can use the shell for other things
  while the program is running.)</li></ul></div></li><li><div class="exercise">
Press the <code>Make Turtle</code> button. A turtle should appear on the canvas 
and a <code>Turtle Control</code> panel should appear in the control panel.
Push the buttons in the <code>Turtle Control</code> panel to move the turtle
around, raise and lower the pen, and change the color of the turtle. Here are
the names of the buttons and what they do:
<pre class="boxed">
  fd    # Move forward.
  lt    # Left turn.
  rt    # Right turn.
  pu    # Lift the pen.
  pd    # Lower the pen.
</pre>
There is a text entry next to <code>fd</code> that controls how far the turtle
moves when the <code>fd</code> button is pushed. This <em>value</em> is an
<em>argument</em> for the <code>fd</code> function.  Change the argument and
press <code>fd</code> again.
</div></li><li><div class="exercise">
Press the <code>Run Code</code> button. It executes the code in the text field, 
which should include the statements:
<pre class="python">
<span class="py-src-variable">world</span>.<span class="py-src-variable">clear</span>()
<span class="py-src-variable">bob</span> = <span class="py-src-variable">Turtle</span>(<span class="py-src-variable">world</span>)
</pre>
The first statement erases all the turtles; the second line creates a new
turtle named <code>bob</code>.
<br /><br />
Notice that there is no <code>Turtle Control</code> panel for <code>bob</code>.
In order to control <code>bob</code>, you have to write a program.
</div></li><li><div class="exercise">
Add a line of code to the program in the text window. To move the turtle, try
something like:
<pre class="python">
<span class="py-src-variable">fd</span>(<span class="py-src-variable">bob</span>, <span class="py-src-number">90</span>)
</pre>
The function <code>fd</code> takes two arguments, the name of a turtle and the
distance you want the turtle to move.  The other turtle control functions are:
<pre class="boxed">
  bk(turtle, distance)  # move a turtle backward
  lt(turtle)            # turn left
  rt(turtle)            # turn right
  pu(turtle)            # pen up
  pd(turtle)            # pen down
</pre>
Experiment with each of these funtions inside the text window.
</div></li><li><div class="exercise">
Make a few errors. If the code you type in the text field contains an error,
you should get an error message in the window you used to run the program.
The message contains information about what was happening when the error
occurred, most of which won't make sense to you. For example, if you spell
world wrong, you'll get something like this:
<pre class="python-interpreter">
  Exception in Tkinter callback
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;/usr/lib/python2.2/lib-tk/Tkinter.py&quot;, line 1300, in __call__
  return apply(self.func, args)
  File &quot;world.py&quot;, line 67, in run_text
  self.inter.run_code(source, '&lt;user-provided code&gt;')
  File &quot;world.py&quot;, line 470, in run_code
  exec code in self.globals, self.locals
  File &quot;&lt;user-provided code&gt;&quot;, line 2, in ?
  NameError: name 'worl' is not defined
</pre>
The last two lines are probably the most useful. The error occurred in line
2 of the <q>user-provided code</q> (that means you). It was a NameError;
specifically, the name worl is not defined.
<br /><br />
In general, error messages are a mixed blessing. They often contain information 
that helps you identify the problem, but they also contain information that is
extraneous at best and misleading at worst. When you are starting out, it is a
good idea to make errors on purpose so that you can see what the messages look
like. Try some of the following:
<ol><li>Leave out one of the parentheses in the function call.</li><li>Put a semi-colon at the end of a line.</li><li>Change <code>Turtle</code> to <code>turtle</code> or <code>bob</code> to
  <code>Bob</code>. Yup, Python is case-sensitive.</li></ol></div></li><li><div class="exercise">
You can define functions in the text field, too. At this point you might want
to quit the program and run it again, so we start fresh.
<br /><br />
Now add the following lines to the text field (after the existing lines):
<pre class="python">
<span class="py-src-keyword">def</span> <span class="py-src-identifier">fdlt</span>(<span class="py-src-parameter">turtle</span>, <span class="py-src-parameter">n</span>):
    <span class="py-src-variable">fd</span>(<span class="py-src-variable">turtle</span>, <span class="py-src-variable">n</span>)
    <span class="py-src-variable">lt</span>(<span class="py-src-variable">turtle</span>)
</pre>
Read the program carefully and make sure you understand what it does. Now run 
it. Did you get what you expected? Reminder: the <em>def statement</em> only
creates a new function; it doesn't execute it. To run the new function, you
have to <em>call</em> it.
</div></li><li><div class="exercise">
Add a line of code that calls <code>fdlt</code>, passing <code>bob</code> as
the first argument and a pleasant distance like <code>90</code> as the second.
Run the program. What happens if the function call comes before the
function definition?
</div></li><li><div class="exercise">
The text field is convenient for typing and running a few lines of code, but
it has the annoying property of vaporizing your code when the program quits.
For longer (and longer-lived) programs, it would be better to put the code in 
a script.
<br /><br />
Create a file named <code>turtle_code.py</code>. Copy and paste the code from
the text field into the file using your favorite editor (vi of course). Save
the file and then press the Run file button. It should execute your code.
</div></li><li><div class="exercise">
In <code>turtle_code.py</code>, add a function named <code>ell</code> that
takes a turtle and a distance as parameters and draws an ell-shape by calling 
<code>fdlt</code> twice. Add a line of code that calls <code>ell</code> (and
remove the old line that called <code>fdlt</code>).
<br /><br />
Save the modified version of <code>turtle_code.py</code> and run it (you don't
have to restart world.py).
</div></li><li><div class="exercise">
Add a function named <code>square</code> that draws a square by calling
<code>ell</code> twice. Test your function.
</div></li><li><div class="exercise">
Create a file named <code>hello.py</code> and write a program that spells the
letters Hello on the canvas. You can write the letters in any style you like;
feel free to embellish them. More important than the style of the letters is
the style of the code! A good solution to this problem should define and use
functions that are well-named, demonstrably correct, appropriately general,
and reusable. Ideally, your solution should be flexible, so that the size of
the letters can be controlled by a parameter.
<br /><br />
For each function you write, add a comment that explains concisely what the
function does. An important piece of information to document is where the
turtle ends up at the end of the function.
<br /><br /><b>Hints:</b><ul><li>You might find it useful to use more than one turtle.</li><li>You can speed up a turtle, or slow it down, by setting its delay
  attribute:
  <pre class="python">
<span class="py-src-variable">bob</span> = <span class="py-src-variable">Turtle</span>(<span class="py-src-variable">world</span>)
<span class="py-src-variable">bob</span>.<span class="py-src-variable">delay</span> = <span class="py-src-number">0.2</span>          <span class="py-src-comment"># time in seconds between moves</span>
</pre></li><li>You might want to start by writing long, repetitive code, and then
  look for recurring idioms that would make good functions.<br /><br /></li></ul><b>Further</b><br /><br />
To change the color of a turtle, try:
<pre class="python">
<span class="py-src-variable">turtle</span>.<span class="py-src-variable">set_color</span>(<span class="py-src-string">'papaya whip'</span>)
</pre>
On an Ubuntu Dapper system the colors python knows about are in the file
<code>/usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt</code>.  To locate this file on a different unix
system, try running:
<pre class="shell">
find . -name rgb.txt 2&gt;/dev/null
</pre>
from within the <code>/</code> directory.
</div></li><li><div class="exercise">
Use your favorite editor (also known as 'vi') to edit the file
<code>world.py</code>. The <code>Turtle</code> class contains a list of
functions that define the behavior of turtles.  Go to the <code>fd</code>
function in the <code>Turtle</code> class. Change <code>fd</code> so that when
turtles draw lines, the lines are the same color as the turtles. Modify
<code>hello.py</code> so that each letter is a different color.
</div></li><li><div class="exercise">
See if you can figure out how to change the thickness of a line.
</div></li><li><div class="exercise">
Go to the function <code>Turtle.draw</code> and see if you can figure it out.
Can you make it draw a two-headed turtle? A turtle with a square shell? A
turtle with thick legs? Or red legs? Or a really big turtle? Or a turtle that
gets bigger depending on how far it is from the center of the screen?
</div></li><li><div class="exercise">
Type the following code in the text field (or in <code>turtle_code.py</code>):
<pre class="python">
<span class="py-src-keyword">def</span> <span class="py-src-identifier">hello</span>():

Run it. Does it make your head hurt?
</div></li><li><div class="exercise">
Try this code:
