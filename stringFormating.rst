Python permits you to format a string using the following syntax:

.. sourcecode:: python

    
    print "%10s%5s%10s%15s%20s" % ("this", "is", "a", "formated", "string")


which will produce the following output:

.. sourcecode:: python

    
          this   is         a       formated              string
