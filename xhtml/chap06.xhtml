the same variable.  A new assignment makes an existing variable refer to a new
value (and stop referring to the old value).</p><pre class="python">
<span class="py-src-variable">bruce</span> = <span class="py-src-number">5</span>
<span class="py-src-keyword">print</span> <span class="py-src-variable">bruce</span>,
<span class="py-src-variable">bruce</span> = <span class="py-src-number">7</span>
<span class="py-src-keyword">print</span> <span class="py-src-variable">bruce</span>
</pre><p>The output of this program is <code>5 7</code>, because the first time
<code>bruce</code> is printed, his value is 5, and the second time, his value
is 7.  The comma at the end of the first <code>print</code> statement
suppresses the newline after the output, which is why both outputs appear on
the same line.</p><p>Here is what <b>multiple assignment</b> looks like in a state
diagram:</p><img src="illustrations/assign2.png" /><p>With multiple assignment it is especially important to distinguish between
an assignment operation and a statement of equality.  Because Python uses the
equal sign (<code>=</code>) for assignment, it is tempting to interpret a
statement like <code>a = b</code> as a statement of equality. It is not!</p><p>First, equality is symmetric and assignment is not.  For example, in
mathematics, if a = 7 then 7 = a.  But in Python, the statement
<code>a = 7</code> is legal and <code>7 = a</code> is not.</p><p>Furthermore, in mathematics, a statement of equality is always true.
If a = b now, then a will always equal b.  In Python, an assignment statement
can make two variables equal, but they don't have to stay that way:</p><pre class="python">
<span class="py-src-variable">a</span> = <span class="py-src-number">5</span>
<span class="py-src-variable">b</span> = <span class="py-src-variable">a</span>    <span class="py-src-comment"># a and b are now equal</span>
<span class="py-src-variable">a</span> = <span class="py-src-number">3</span>    <span class="py-src-comment"># a and b are no longer equal</span>
</pre><p>The third line changes the value of <code>a</code> but does not change the
value of <code>b</code>, so they are no longer equal. (In some programming
languages, a different symbol is used for assignment, such as
<code>&lt;-</code> or <code>:=</code>, to avoid confusion.)</p><h2>6.2 Updating variables<a name="auto1"></a></h2><p>One of the most common forms of multiple assignment is an update, where the
new value of the variable depends on the old.</p><pre class="python">
<span class="py-src-variable">x</span> = <span class="py-src-variable">x</span> + <span class="py-src-number">1</span>
</pre><p>This means <q>get the current value of x, add one, and then update x with
the new value.</q></p><p>If you try to update a variable that doesn't exist, you get an error,
because Python evaluates the expression on the right side of the assignment
operator before it assigns the resulting value to the name on the left:</p><pre class="python">
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="py-src-variable">x</span> = <span class="py-src-variable">x</span> + <span class="py-src-number">1</span>
<span class="py-src-variable">Traceback</span> (<span class="py-src-variable">most</span> <span class="py-src-variable">recent</span> <span class="py-src-variable">call</span> <span class="py-src-variable">last</span>):
  <span class="py-src-variable">File</span> <span class="py-src-string">&quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;</span>, <span class="py-src-variable">line</span> <span class="py-src-number">1</span>, <span class="py-src-keyword">in</span> &lt;<span class="py-src-variable">module</span>&gt;
<span class="py-src-variable">NameError</span>: <span class="py-src-variable">name</span> <span class="py-src-string">'x'</span> <span class="py-src-keyword">is</span> <span class="py-src-keyword">not</span> <span class="py-src-variable">defined</span>
</pre><p>Before you can update a variable, you have to <b>initialize</b> it, usually
with a simple assignment:</p><pre class="python">
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="py-src-variable">x</span> = <span class="py-src-number">0</span>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="py-src-variable">x</span> = <span class="py-src-variable">x</span> + <span class="py-src-number">1</span>
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre><p>Updating a variable by adding 1 is called an <b>increment</b>; subtracting
1 is called a <b>decrement</b>.</p><h2>6.3 The <code>while</code> statement<a name="auto2"></a></h2><a name="index05"></a><a name="index06"></a><a name="index07"></a><a name="index08"></a><p>Computers are often used to automate repetitive tasks.  Repeating identical
or similar tasks without making errors is something that computers do well and
people do poorly.</p><p>Repeated execution of a set of statements is called <b>iteration</b>.
Because iteration is so common, Python provides several language features to
make it easier.  The first feature we are going to look at is the
<code>while</code> statement.</p><p>Here is a function called <code>countdown</code> that demonstrates the
use of the <code>while</code> statement:</p><pre class="python">
<span class="py-src-keyword">def</span> <span class="py-src-identifier">countdown</span>(<span class="py-src-parameter">n</span>):
    <span class="py-src-keyword">while</span> <span class="py-src-variable">n</span> &gt; <span class="py-src-number">0</span>:
        <span class="py-src-keyword">print</span> <span class="py-src-variable">n</span>
        <span class="py-src-variable">n</span> = <span class="py-src-variable">n</span>-<span class="py-src-number">1</span>
    <span class="py-src-keyword">print</span> <span class="py-src-string">&quot;Blastoff!&quot;</span>
</pre><p>You can almost read the <code>while</code> statement as if it were English.
It means, <q>While <code>n</code> is greater than 0, continue displaying the
value of <code>n</code> and then reducing the value of <code>n</code> by 1.
When you get to 0, display the word <code>Blastoff!</code></q></p><p>More formally, here is the flow of execution for a <code>while</code>
statement:</p><ol><li>Evaluate the condition, yielding <code>False</code> or <code>True</code>.
</li><li>If the condition is false, exit the <code>while</code> statement and
continue execution at the next statement.</li><li>If the condition is true, execute each of the statements in the body
and then go back to step 1.</li></ol><p>The body consists of all of the statements below the header with the same
indentation.</p><p>This type of flow is called a <b>loop</b> because the third step
loops back around to the top.  Notice that if the condition is false the first
time through the loop, the statements inside the loop are never executed.</p><a name="index09"></a><a name="index10"></a><a name="index11"></a><a name="index12"></a><a name="index13"></a><a name="index14"></a><p>The body of the loop should change the value of one or more variables
so that eventually the condition becomes false and the loop terminates.
Otherwise the loop will repeat forever, which is called an
<b>infinite loop</b>.  An endless source of amusement for computer
scientists is the observation that the directions on shampoo, <q>Lather, rinse, repeat,</q> are an infinite loop.</p><p>In the case of <code>countdown</code>, we can prove that the loop terminates 
because we know that the value of <code>n</code> is finite, and we can see that 
the value of <code>n</code> gets smaller each time through the loop, so
eventually we have to get to 0.  In other cases, it is not so easy to tell:</p><pre class="python">
<span class="py-src-keyword">def</span> <span class="py-src-identifier">sequence</span>(<span class="py-src-parameter">n</span>):
    <span class="py-src-keyword">while</span> <span class="py-src-variable">n</span> != <span class="py-src-number">1</span>:
        <span class="py-src-keyword">print</span> <span class="py-src-variable">n</span>,
        <span class="py-src-keyword">if</span> <span class="py-src-variable">n</span> % <span class="py-src-number">2</span> == <span class="py-src-number">0</span>:        <span class="py-src-comment"># n is even</span>
            <span class="py-src-variable">n</span> = <span class="py-src-variable">n</span> / <span class="py-src-number">2</span>

</pre><p>The condition for this loop is <code>n != 1</code>, so the loop will
continue until <code>n</code> is <code>1</code>, which will make the condition
false.</p><p>Each time through the loop, the program outputs the value of <code>n</code>
and then checks whether it is even or odd.  If it is even, the value of
<code>n</code> is divided by 2.  If it is odd, the value is replaced by
<code>n * 3 + 1</code>. For example, if the starting value (the argument passed
to sequence) is 3, the resulting sequence is 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.</p><p>Since <code>n</code> sometimes increases and sometimes decreases, there is
no obvious proof that <code>n</code> will ever reach 1, or that the program
terminates.  For some particular values of <code>n</code>, we can prove
termination.  For example, if the starting value is a power of two, then the
value of <code>n</code> will be even each time through the loop until it
reaches 1. The previous example ends with such a sequence, starting with 16.
</p><p>Particular values aside, the interesting question is whether we can prove
that this program terminates for <em>all</em> values of <code>n</code>.  So
far, no one has been able to prove it <em>or</em> disprove it!</p><h2>6.4 Tracing a program<a name="auto3"></a></h2><a name="index15"></a><a name="index16"></a><a name="index17"></a><p>To write effective computer programs a programmer needs to develop the
ability to <b>trace</b> the execution of a computer program.  Tracing involves
<q>becoming the computer</q> and following the flow of execution through a
sample program run, recording the state of all variables and any output the
program generates after each instruction is executed.</p><p>To understand this process, let's trace the call to <code>sequence(3)</code>
from the previous section.  At the start of the trace, we have a local
variable, <code>n</code> (the parameter), with an initial value of 3.  Since 
3 is not equal to 1, the <code>while</code> loop body is executed.  3 is
printed and <code>3 % 2 == 0</code> is evaluated.  Since it evaluates to
<code>False</code>, the <code>else</code> branch is executed and
<code>3 * 3 + 1</code> is evaluated and assigned to <code>n</code>.
</p><p>To keep track of all this as you hand trace a program, make a column heading
on a piece of paper for each variable created as the program runs and another
one for output.  Our trace so far would look something like this:</p><pre class="boxed">
   n              output
  ---             ------
   3                 3
   10
</pre><p>Since <code>10 != 1</code> evaluates to <code>True</code>, the loop body
is again executed, and 10 is printed.  <code>10 % 2 == 0</code> is true, so
the <code>if</code> branch is executed and <code>n</code> becomes 5.  By the
end of the trace we have:</p><pre class="boxed">
   n              output
  ---             ------
   3                 3
   10                10
   5                 5
   16                16
   8                 8
   4                 4
   2                 2
   1
</pre><p>Tracing can be a bit tedious and error prone (that's why we get computers
to do this stuff in the first place!), but it is an essential skill for a
programmer to have.  From this trace we can learn a lot about the way our
code works.  We can observe that as soon as n becomes a power of 2, for example,
the program will require log<sub>2</sub>(n) executions of the loop body to
complete.  We can also see that the final 1 will not be printed as output.
</p><h2>6.5 Counting digits<a name="auto4"></a></h2><a name="index18"></a><p>The following function counts the number of decimal digits in a positive
integer expressed in decimal format:</p><pre class="python">

</pre><p>A call to <code>num_digits(710)</code> will return <code>3</code>.  Trace
the execution of this function call to convince yourself that it works.</p><p>This function demonstrates another pattern of computation called a
<b>counter</b>.  The variable <code>count</code> is initialized to 0 and then
incremented each time the loop body is executed.  When the loop exits,
<code>count</code> contains the result -- the total number of times the loop
body was executed, which is the same as the number of digits.</p><p>If we wanted to only count digits that are either 0 or 5, adding a
conditional before incrementing the counter will do the trick:</p><pre class="python">

</p><h2>6.6 Abbreviated assignment<a name="auto5"></a></h2><p>Incrementing a variable is so common that Python provides an abbreviated
syntax for it:</p><pre class="python-interpreter">

&gt;&gt;&gt; count
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; count += 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; count

&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre><p><code>count += 1</code> is an abreviation for <code>count = count + 1</code> .
The increment value does not have to be 1:</p><pre class="python-interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; n = 2
&gt;&gt;&gt; n += 5
&gt;&gt;&gt; n
7
&gt;&gt;&gt;

</pre><h2>6.7 Tables<a name="auto6"></a></h2><a name="tables"></a><a name="index19"></a><a name="index20"></a><p>One of the things loops are good for is generating tabular data.  Before
computers were readily available, people had to calculate logarithms, sines and 
cosines, and other mathematical functions by hand.  To make that easier,
mathematics books contained long tables listing the values of these functions.  
Creating the tables was slow and boring, and they tended to be full of errors.
</p><p>When computers appeared on the scene, one of the initial reactions was,
<q>This is great!  We can use the computers to generate the tables, so there
will be no errors.</q> That turned out to be true (mostly) but shortsighted.
Soon thereafter, computers and calculators were so pervasive that the tables
became obsolete.</p><p>Well, almost.  For some operations, computers use tables of values to get an 
approximate answer and then perform computations to improve the approximation.  
In some cases, there have been errors in the underlying tables, most famously
in the table the Intel Pentium used to perform floating-point division.</p><a name="index21"></a><a name="index22"></a><p>Although a log table is not as useful as it once was, it still makes a good
example of iteration.  The following program outputs a sequence of values in
the left column and 2 raised to the power of that value in the right column:
</p><pre class="python">
<span class="py-src-variable">x</span> = <span class="py-src-number">1</span>

    <span class="py-src-variable">x</span> += <span class="py-src-number">1</span>
</pre><a name="index23"></a><p>The string '\t' represents a <b>tab</b> character.  The backslash character
in '\t' indicates the beginning of an <b>escape sequence</b>.  Escape sequences 
are used to represent invisible characters like tabs and newlines.  The
sequence \n represents a <b>newline</b>.</p><p>An escape sequence can appear anywhere in a string; in this example, the tab
escape sequence is the only thing in the string.  How do you think you
represent a backslash in a string?</p><p>As characters and strings are displayed on the screen, an invisible marker
called the <b>cursor</b> keeps track of where the next character will 
go.  After a <code>print</code> statement, the cursor normally goes to the
beginning of the next line.</p><p>The tab character shifts the cursor to the right until it reaches one of the 
tab stops.  Tabs are useful for making columns of text line up, as in the
output of the previous program:</p><pre class="shell">
1       2

10      1024
11      2048
12      4096
</pre><p>Because of the tab characters between the columns, the position of the
second column does not depend on the number of digits in the first column.</p><h2>6.8 Two-dimensional tables<a name="auto7"></a></h2><a name="index24"></a><p>A two-dimensional table is a table where you read the value at the
intersection of a row and a column.  A multiplication table is a good example.
Let's say you want to print a multiplication table for the values from 1 to 6.
</p><p>A good way to start is to write a loop that prints the multiples of 2, all
on one line:</p><pre class="python">
<span class="py-src-variable">i</span> = <span class="py-src-number">1</span>
<span class="py-src-keyword">while</span> <span class="py-src-variable">i</span> &lt;= <span class="py-src-number">6</span>:
    <span class="py-src-keyword">print</span> <span class="py-src-number">2</span>*<span class="py-src-variable">i</span>, <span class="py-src-string">'   '</span>,
    <span class="py-src-variable">i</span> += <span class="py-src-number">1</span>
<span class="py-src-keyword">print</span>
</pre><p>The first line initializes a variable named <code>i</code>, which acts as a
counter or <b>loop variable</b>.  As the loop executes, the value of
<code>i</code> increases from 1 to 6.  When <code>i</code> is 7, the loop
terminates.  Each time through the loop, it displays the value of
<code>2*i</code>, followed by three spaces.</p><p>Again, the comma in the <code>print</code> statement suppresses the newline.
After the loop completes, the second <code>print</code> statement starts a new
line.</p><p>The output of the program is:</p><pre class="shell">
2      4      6      8      10     12
</pre><p>So far, so good. The next step is to <b>encapsulate</b> and
<b>generalize</b>.</p><h2>6.9 Encapsulation and generalization<a name="auto8"></a></h2><a name="encapsulation"></a><a name="index25"></a><a name="index26"></a><a name="index27"></a><a name="index28"></a><p>Encapsulation is the process of wrapping a piece of code in a function,
allowing you to take advantage of all the things functions are good for.  You
have already seen two examples of encapsulation: <code>print_parity</code> in
chapter 4; and <code>is_divisible</code> in chapter 5.</p><p>Generalization means taking something specific, such as printing the
multiples of 2, and making it more general, such as printing the multiples of
any integer.</p><p>This function encapsulates the previous loop and generalizes it to print
multiples of <code>n</code>:</p><pre class="python">
<span class="py-src-keyword">def</span> <span class="py-src-identifier">print_multiples</span>(<span class="py-src-parameter">n</span>):

    <span class="py-src-keyword">print</span>
</pre><p>To encapsulate, all we had to do was add the first line, which declares the
name of the function and the parameter list.  To generalize, all we had to do
was replace the value 2 with the parameter <code>n</code>.</p><p>If we call this function with the argument 2, we get the same output as
before.  With the argument 3, the output is:</p><pre class="shell">
3      6      9      12     15     18
</pre><p>With the argument 4, the output is:</p><pre class="shell">
4      8      12     16     20     24
</pre><p>By now you can probably guess how to print a multiplication table---by
calling <code>print_multiples</code> repeatedly with different arguments.  In
fact, we can use another loop:</p><pre class="python">
<span class="py-src-variable">i</span> = <span class="py-src-number">1</span>

    <span class="py-src-variable">i</span> += <span class="py-src-number">1</span>
</pre><p>Notice how similar this loop is to the one inside
<code>print_multiples</code>.  All we did was replace the <code>print</code>
statement with a function call.</p><p>The output of this program is a multiplication table:</p><pre class="shell">

</pre><h2>6.10 More encapsulation<a name="auto9"></a></h2><p>To demonstrate encapsulation again, let's take the code from the last 
section and wrap it up in a function:</p><pre class="python">
<span class="py-src-keyword">def</span> <span class="py-src-identifier">print_mult_table</span>():
    <span class="py-src-variable">i</span> = <span class="py-src-number">1</span>
    <span class="py-src-keyword">while</span> <span class="py-src-variable">i</span> &lt;= <span class="py-src-number">6</span>:
        <span class="py-src-variable">print_multiples</span>(<span class="py-src-variable">i</span>)
        <span class="py-src-variable">i</span> += <span class="py-src-number">1</span>
</pre><p>This process is a common <b>development plan</b>.  We develop code 
by writing lines of code outside any function, or typing them in to the
interpreter.  When we get the code working, we extract it and wrap it up in a
function.</p><p>This development plan is particularly useful if you don't know how to divide 
the program into functions when you start writing.  This approach lets you
design as you go along.</p><h2>6.11 Local variables<a name="auto10"></a></h2><a name="index29"></a><a name="index30"></a><p>You might be wondering how we can use the same variable, <code>i</code>, in
both <code>print_multiples</code> and <code>print_mult_table</code>.  Doesn't it
cause problems when one of the functions changes the value of the variable?</p><p>The answer is no, because the <code>i</code> in <code>print_multiples</code>
and the <code>i</code> in <code>print_mult_table</code> are <em>not</em> the
same variable.</p><p>Variables created inside a function definition are local; you can't access a 
local variable from outside its <q>home</q> function.  That means you are free
to have multiple variables with the same name as long as they are not in the
same function.</p><p>The stack diagram for this program shows that the two variables named
<code>i</code> are not the same variable.  They can refer to different values,
and changing one does not affect the other.</p><img src="illustrations/stack4.png" /><p>The value of <code>i</code> in <code>print_mult_table</code> goes from 1 to
6.  In the diagram it happens to be 3.  The next time through the loop it will
be 4.  Each time through the loop, <code>print_mult_table</code> calls
<code>print_multiples</code> with the current value of <code>i</code> as an
argument.  That value gets assigned to the parameter <code>n</code>.</p><p>Inside <code>print_multiples</code>, the value of <code>i</code> goes from
1 to 6.  In the diagram, it happens to be 2.  Changing this variable has no
effect on the value of <code>i</code> in <code>print_mult_table</code>.</p><p>It is common and perfectly legal to have different local variables with the
same name.  In particular, names like <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> are
used frequently as loop variables.  If you avoid using them in one function
just because you used them somewhere else, you will probably make the program
harder to read.</p><h2>6.12 More generalization<a name="auto11"></a></h2><p>As another example of generalization, imagine you wanted a program that
would print a multiplication table of any size, not just the six-by-six table.
You could add a parameter to <code>print_mult_table</code>:</p><pre class="python">
<span class="py-src-keyword">def</span> <span class="py-src-identifier">print_mult_table</span>(<span class="py-src-parameter">high</span>):
    <span class="py-src-variable">i</span> = <span class="py-src-number">1</span>
    <span class="py-src-keyword">while</span> <span class="py-src-variable">i</span> &lt;= <span class="py-src-variable">high</span>:
        <span class="py-src-variable">print_multiples</span>(<span class="py-src-variable">i</span>)
        <span class="py-src-variable">i</span> += <span class="py-src-number">1</span>
</pre><p>We replaced the value 6 with the parameter <code>high</code>.  If we call
<code>print_mult_table</code> with the argument 7, it displays:</p><pre class="shell">
1      2      3      4      5      6
2      4      6      8      10     12
3      6      9      12     15     18
4      8      12     16     20     24
5      10     15     20     25     30
6      12     18     24     30     36
7      14     21     28     35     42
</pre><p>This is fine, except that we probably want the table to be square---with the 
same number of rows and columns.  To do that, we add another parameter to
<code>print_multiples</code> to specify how many columns the table should have.
</p><p>Just to be annoying, we call this parameter <code>high</code>, demonstrating
that different functions can have parameters with the same name (just like
local variables).  Here's the whole program:</p><pre class="python">
<span class="py-src-keyword">def</span> <span class="py-src-identifier">print_multiples</span>(<span class="py-src-parameter">n</span>, <span class="py-src-parameter">high</span>):
    <span class="py-src-variable">i</span> = <span class="py-src-number">1</span>
    <span class="py-src-keyword">while</span> <span class="py-src-variable">i</span> &lt;= <span class="py-src-variable">high</span>:
        <span class="py-src-keyword">print</span> <span class="py-src-variable">n</span>*<span class="py-src-variable">i</span>, <span class="py-src-string">'\t'</span>,
        <span class="py-src-variable">i</span> += <span class="py-src-number">1</span>
    <span class="py-src-keyword">print</span>
   
<span class="py-src-keyword">def</span> <span class="py-src-identifier">print_mult_table</span>(<span class="py-src-parameter">high</span>):
    <span class="py-src-variable">i</span> = <span class="py-src-number">1</span>

        <span class="py-src-variable">i</span> += <span class="py-src-number">1</span>
</pre><p>Notice that when we added a new parameter, we had to change the first line
of the function (the function heading), and we also had to change the place
where the function is called in <code>print_mult_table</code>.</p><p>As expected, this program generates a square seven-by-seven table:</p><pre class="shell">
1      2      3      4      5      6      7
2      4      6      8      10     12     14

5      10     15     20     25     30     35
6      12     18     24     30     36     42
7      14     21     28     35     42     49
</pre><p>When you generalize a function appropriately, you often get a program with
capabilities you didn't plan.  For example, you might notice that, because
ab = ba, all the entries in the table appear twice.  You could save ink by
printing only half the table.  To do that, you only have to change one line of
<code>print_mult_table</code>.  Change</p><pre class="python">
<span class="py-src-variable">print_multiples</span>(<span class="py-src-variable">i</span>, <span class="py-src-variable">high</span>)

are some of them:</p><ol><li>Giving a name to a sequence of statements makes your program easier to read

almost any approximation, you can compute a better approximation with the

process for solving a category of problems (in this case, computing square
roots).</p><p>It is not easy to define an algorithm. It might help to start with something
that is not an algorithm. When you learned to multiply single-digit numbers,
you probably memorized the multiplication table. In effect, you memorized 100
specific solutions. That kind of knowledge is not algorithmic.</p><p>But if you were <q>lazy,</q> you probably cheated by learning a few tricks.
For example, to find the product of n and 9, you can write n - 1 as the first
digit and 10 - n as the second digit. This trick is a general solution for
multiplying any single-digit number by 9. That's an algorithm!</p><p>Similarly, the techniques you learned for addition with carrying,
subtraction with borrowing, and long division are all algorithms. One of the
characteristics of algorithms is that they do not require any intelligence to
carry out. They are mechanical processes in which each step follows from the
last according to a simple set of rules.</p><p>In our opinion, it is embarrassing that humans spend so much time in school
learning to execute algorithms that, quite literally, require no intelligence.
</p><p>On the other hand, the process of designing algorithms is interesting,
intellectually challenging, and a central part of what we call programming.</p><p>Some of the things that people do naturally, without difficulty or conscious
thought, are the hardest to express algorithmically. Understanding natural
language is a good example. We all do it, but so far no one has been able
to explain <em>how</em> we do it, at least not in the form of an algorithm.</p><h2>6.16 Glossary<a name="auto15"></a></h2><a name="index33"></a><a name="index34"></a><a name="index35"></a><a name="index36"></a><a name="index37"></a><a name="index38"></a><a name="index39"></a><a name="index40"></a><a name="index41"></a><a name="index42"></a><a name="index43"></a><a name="index44"></a><a name="index45"></a><a name="index46"></a><a name="index47"></a><a name="index48"></a><a name="index49"></a><a name="index50"></a><a name="index51"></a><a name="index52"></a><a name="index53"></a><a name="index54"></a><a name="index55"></a><dl><dt>multiple assignment:</dt><dd>Making more than one assignment to the same variable during the execution
